# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a morning show to the Country Radio Channel schedule with weekday morning time slots.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new morning show entry with title, description, and image
- Add weekday schedule entries (Monday-Friday) for the morning show with 6:00 AM - 10:00 AM time slot
- Display the morning show in both the admin dashboard and public schedule view

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view the new morning show in the weekly schedule on the homepage (Monday-Friday mornings), and admins can manage the show and its schedule entries in the admin dashboard.
